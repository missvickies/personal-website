# My Personal Website

This project was designed on figma, then brought to life using React.js and Styled-Components.

## The Design

This is my personal website. It is a simple and straight to the point one-pager. The style inspiration came from Figma, an online editor where people can brainstorm, collaborate and give comments through sticky notes like the ones seen above. I selected this theme for my website because it mirrors a small part of my personality as I place great importance on teamwork, feedback, and personal growth.

## Technical Details

The technical tools I used are React and Styled-Components. Then deployed with Netlify. 

### Adding Responsiveness

By using CSS-Grid and flex-box, we are able to achieve responsiveness on mobile, laptop, and desktop.

### Overlapping Layouts

By using CSS-Grid, I was able to create a 75x75 pixel sized grid over the page. 

This grid helps keep track of the placements of my sticky notes and photos.

By assigning just one grid item to each of my sticky notes, I was able to set my notes to a fixed width and height while keeping the overlapping layout of my notes.

Since the sizing of the items do not strictly follow the grid, this method adds a messy layout effect that I was looking for.
