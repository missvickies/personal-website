This project was designed on figma, then brought to life using React.js and Styled-Components.

## The Design

This is my personal website. It is a simple and straight to the point one-pager. The style inspiration came from Figma, an online editor where people can brainstorm, collaborate and give comments through sticky notes like the ones seen above. I selected this theme for my website because it mirrors a small part of my personality as I place great importance on teamwork, feedback, and personal growth.

### Running the website

To start, open the project up and run:
- npm install
- npm start

this runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
